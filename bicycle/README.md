```bash
./bike.out  ../../../Documents/Work_Space-1/S_BP/bicycle_Hx  ../../../Documents/Work_Space-1/S_BP/bicycle_Hz l 3 3 0 1 3 0 4 17"
```  
Where n=2l, n should be 10,58,106,166... so l=5,29,53,83..  
3 3 are wt of the 2 polynomials,  0 1 3 / 0 4 17 are position of non-zero entries of those 2 polynomials, so they are 1+x+x^3 and 1+x^4+x^17
